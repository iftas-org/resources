## Detection
Services exist to compare stored media with hashes of known material, and ML-assisted perceptual matches. For the most part, these are heavily restricted and will require your ability to sign legal agreements with the service providers. If you are an independent provider and would like to use IFTAS detection services, please fill out this Needs Assessment: https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/thnEBypiNlR6qklaQNmWAkoxxeEEJdElpzM7h2ZIwXA/
