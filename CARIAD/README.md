The CARIAD project is a domain list. Operators of ActivityPub services may or may not use this database information to classify or block an IP address or domain, it is their choice to do so.

All delistings are free of charge.

In order to delist a domain, a request must be sent from an address at the listed domain (eg: abuse@listed-domain.tld) to our contact address below, with evidence that the issue has been resolved. We may verify the address by sending back a confirmation message and asking for a response.

Requests are typically investigated and processed within three business days.

Delisting requests must be send to the delisting email address, written in English language, in text form: delist-cariad (a) iftas (.) org
