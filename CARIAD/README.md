_The day one denylist for new admins_

The CARIAD project observes the domain blocks in place on some of the largest and most active service providers, and observes where a majority of those servers exhibit the same blocks. After manual review, domains are added to the list, alongside IFTAS' [DNI list](https://github.com/iftas-org/resources/blob/main/DNI/dni.csv).

CARIAD is intended to provide new service providers a basic, first step in defederating the domains already widely defederated by existing service providers. 

For more information see FINAL VERSION LINK HERE 

The CARIAD list is available via FediCheck. it is not intended for import as a CSV. FediCheck users can review observed reasons and IFTAS labels where available.

We support fair practices and offer a process for delisting domains that have addressed the reasons for their listing. An audit file is publicly available for review. 

In order to delist a domain, a request must be sent from an address at the listed domain (eg: ``abuse@listed-domain.tld``) to our contact address below, with evidence that the issue has been resolved. We may verify the address by sending back a confirmation message asking for a response.

Delisting requests must be sent to the delisting email address, written in English language, in plaint text form: delist-cariad (a) iftas (.) org

Requests are typically investigated and processed within three business days.

All delistings are free of charge.
