The CARIAD project aims to maintain a healthy digital ecosystem by helping ActivityPub service providers to classify or block domains exhibiting harmful behavior. Our commitment to freedom of association means everyone is free to block anyone, at any time, for any reason. ActivityPub is predominantly a volunteer-operated messaging service, and as such, no-one can be forced to accept your content.

We support fair practices and offer a process for delisting domains that have addressed the reasons for their initial listing.

In order to delist a domain, a request must be sent from an address at the listed domain (eg: abuse@listed-domain.tld) to our contact address below, with evidence that the issue has been resolved. We may verify the address by sending back a confirmation message and asking for a response.

Delisting requests must be send to the delisting email address, written in English language, in text form: delist-cariad (a) iftas (.) org

Requests are typically investigated and processed within three business days.

All delistings are free of charge.
