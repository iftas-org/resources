# CARIAD

## The day one denylist for new admins

The CARIAD project observes the domain blocks in place on some of the largest and most active service providers, and observes where a majority of those servers exhibit the same blocks. After manual review, domains are added to the list, alongside IFTAS' [DNI list](https://github.com/iftas-org/resources/blob/main/DNI/dni.csv).

CARIAD is intended to provide new service providers a basic, first step in defederating the domains already widely defederated by existing service providers. 

For more information see the [policy specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hmGNHqifYGRwk1qsWUaCI-VDHw3yMvjVoy-c_8K4e9c/edit?usp=sharing). 

The CARIAD list is available via FediCheck. it is not intended for import as a CSV. FediCheck users can review observed reasons and IFTAS labels where available.

We support fair practices and offer a process for delisting domains that have addressed the reasons for their listing. An audit file is publicly available for review. 

In order to delist a domain, a request must be sent from an address at the listed domain (eg: ``abuse@listed-domain.tld``) to our contact address below, with evidence that the issue has been resolved. We may verify the address by sending back a confirmation message asking for a response.

Delisting requests must be sent to the delisting email address, written in English language, in plaint text form: delist-cariad (a) iftas (.) org

Requests are typically investigated and processed within three business days.

All delistings are free of charge.
